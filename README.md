## PURPOSE OF THE PLUGIN
CanaryLatch is a plugin that allows players to block their Minecraft account on
a CanaryMod server.
The theft of games accounts is a rising trend in the online world, and 
Minecraft is one of the most known social games on Earth, specially as it's 
very popular between children and young teenagers.
CanaryLatch can also be used as an additional security layer for Parental 
Control, although in the present version allows to control only one account per 
smartphone. Next versions will allow to manage differente accounts.

## WHY I WROTE CANARY LATCH
It's been a long time since I first know people were doing impressive things
with Minecraft like teaching coding, exploring virtual archaeological sites, or
publishing a MC edition of the Brittish geological cartography. 

As a creative coder it was something I wanted to get involved with. I am a 
father too, so I am very concerned with ciber security, children safety, and
specially harrasment as well as accesibility. It was a matter of time that I 
knew [Autcraft](http://www.autcraft.com). At the moment (and still now) I am
in the middle of a creative artwork, but I knew a Spanish version of autcraft
will be my next project in 2015.

So when I get noticed of the 
[Latch Plugin Contest](https://latchcontest.elevenpaths.com/) I thought it was 
a great opportunity to start shaping my dream.

## MAIN USE CASES
I think there are two main cases for the tool, but who knows what the community
will be able to create:  
1. Protect your account. Game accounts are a digital good in risk of theft,
impersonation or hijacking. CanaryLatch is an additional security layer to keep
safe our favourite hobby.  
1. Parental Control. Pairing your child account with your smartphone turns 
CanaryLatch into an easy-to-use parental control tool.

## KNOWN USERS
**Be the first to install CanaryLatch in your server!**

Don't hesitate to contact if you have doubts about using it.

## COMING FEATURES
**CanaryLatch** is an ongoing development. There are still some features I
want to add to it yet:  
1. A **CanaryLatchHook** and that will allow other developers to create plugins
triggered by changes in the users latch accounts.  
1. Several accounts depending on a latch device, what will make CanaryLatch a
more useful tool for Parental Control (in case you have more than one kid xD).  
1. A short API for easy other developers to create services pending on the
latch account.  
1. Some CanaryMod plugins allow to protect a world zone to make it belongs to
a player and avoid other players to modify it. I want to add the ability to 
control this block with latch, so you can allow a friend to work on your zone
remotely using your smartphone.
